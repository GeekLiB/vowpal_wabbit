This is the *vowpal wabbit* fast online learning code.  For Windows, look at README.windows.txt

## Prerequisite software

These prerequisites are usually pre-installed on many platforms. However, you may need to consult your favorite package
manager (*yum*, *apt*, *MacPorts*, *brew*, ...) to install missing software.

- [Boost](http://www.boost.org) library, with the `Boost::Program_Options` library option enabled.
- lsb-release  (RedHat/CentOS: redhat-lsb-core, Debian: lsb-release, Ubuntu: you're all set, OSX: not required)
- GNU *autotools*: *autoconf*, *automake*, *libtool*, *autoheader*, et. al. This is not a strict prereq. On many systems (notably Ubuntu with `libboost-program-options-dev` installed), the provided `Makefile` works fine.
- (optional) [git](http://git-scm.com) if you want to check out the latest version of *vowpal wabbit*,
  work on the code, or even contribute code to the main project.

## Getting the code

You can download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Download).
The very latest version is always available via 'github' by invoking one of the following:

```
## For the traditional ssh-based Git interaction:
$ git clone git://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit.git

## For HTTP-based Git interaction
$ git clone https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit.git
```

## Compiling

You should be able to build the *vowpal wabbit* on most systems with:
```
$ make
$ make test    # (optional)
```

If that fails, try:
```
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make
$ make test    # (optional)
$ make install
```

Note that `./autogen.sh` requires *automake* (see the prerequisites, above.)

`./autogen.sh`'s command line arguments are passed directly to `configure` as
if they were `configure` arguments and flags.

Note that `./autogen.sh` will overwrite the supplied `Makefile`, so
keeping a copy of `Makefile` may be a good idea before running `autogen.sh`.

Be sure to read the wiki: https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki
for the tutorial, command line options, etc.

The 'cluster' directory has it's own documentation for cluster
parallel use, and the examples at the end of test/Runtests give some
example flags.

## C++ Optimization

The default C++ compiler optimization flags are very aggressive. If you should run into a problem, consider creating and running `configure` with the `--enable-debug` option, e.g.:

```
$ ./configure --enable-debug
```

or passing your own compiler flags via the `OPTIM_FLAGS` make variable:

```
$ make OPTIM_FLAGS="-O0 -g"
```

## Ubuntu/Debian specific info

On Ubuntu/Debian/Mint and similar the following sequence should work
for building the latest from github:

```
# -- Get libboost program-options and zlib:
apt-get install libboost-program-options-dev zlib1g-dev

# -- Get the python libboost bindings (python subdir) - optional:
apt-get install libboost-python-dev

# -- Get the vw source:
git clone git://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit.git

# -- Build:
cd vowpal_wabbit
make
make test       # (optional)
make install
```

### Ubuntu advanced build options (clang and static)

If you prefer building with `clang` instead of `gcc` (much faster build
and slighly faster executable), install `clang` and change the `make`
step slightly:

```
apt-get install clang

make CXX=clang++
```

A statically linked `vw` executable that is not sensitive to boost
version upgrades and can be safely copied between different Linux
versions (e.g. even from Ubuntu to Red-Hat) can be built and tested with:

```
make CXX='clang++ -static' clean vw test     # ignore warnings
```

## Mac OS X-specific info

OSX requires _glibtools_, which is available via the [brew](http://brew.sh) or
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) package managers.

### Complete brew install of 8.0
```
brew install vowpal-wabbit
```
[The homebrew formula for VW is located on github](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/vowpal-wabbit.rb).

### Manual install of Vowpal Wabbit
#### OSX Dependencies (if using Brew):
```
brew install libtool
brew install autoconf
brew install automake
brew install boost
brew install boost-python
```

#### OSX Dependencies (if using MacPorts):
```
## Install glibtool and other GNU autotool friends:
$ port install libtool autoconf automake

## Build Boost for Mac OS X 10.8 and below
$ port install boost +no_single +no_static +openmpi +python27 configure.cxx_stdlib=libc++ configure.cxx=clang++

## Build Boost for Mac OS X 10.9 and above
$ port install boost +no_single +no_static +openmpi +python27
```

#### OSX Manual compile:
*Mac OS X 10.8 and below*: ``configure.cxx_stdlib=libc++`` and ``configure.cxx=clang++`` ensure that ``clang++`` uses
the correct C++11 functionality while building Boost. Ordinarily, ``clang++`` relies on the older GNU ``g++`` 4.2 series
header files and ``stdc++`` library; ``libc++`` is the ``clang`` replacement that provides newer C++11 functionality. If
these flags aren't present, you will likely encounter compilation errors when compiling _vowpalwabbit/cbify.cc_. These
error messages generally contain complaints about ``std::to_string`` and ``std::unique_ptr`` types missing.

To compile:
```
$ sh autogen.sh --enable-libc++
$ make
$ make test    # (optional)
```
